🔗 [Live Demo](https://abdallahbenj.github.io/Book-inventory/)git

## Overview

This project is part of the certification requirements. In this lab, I built a **Book Inventory App** that displays and categorizes books using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The main focus is on using **CSS attribute selectors** to style elements based on their custom attributes.

## Project Details

- **Project Type**: Inventory Management Interface
- **Purpose**: Practice using powerful CSS attribute selectors to style dynamic data.
- **Skills Learned**: HTML semantics, CSS attribute selectors, responsive UI

## Features

- 📚 **Book Display**: Shows a list of books with details such as title, author, genre, and availability.
- 🎯 **CSS Attribute Selectors**: Uses selectors like `[attribute]`, `[attribute=value]`, `[attribute~=value]`, `[attribute^=value]`, and `[attribute$=value]` for targeted styling.
- 🖌️ **Dynamic Styling**: Visually differentiate books based on their genre, status (available/unavailable), or tags using pure CSS.
- 🧠 **Semantic HTML**: Structured content using meaningful HTML tags and data attributes.
- 🔍 **Search and Filter**: (Optional enhancement) Filter books by genre or availability using JavaScript.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Markup structure with semantic elements and data attributes
- **CSS**: Attribute selectors for conditional styling
- **JavaScript**: For interactivity and filtering (optional)
